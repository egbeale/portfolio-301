      "description": "I'm Elizabeth, an aspiring software development in Seattle. After attending law school for two years, I realized that while I enjoy thinking analytically, I want to use that logic to build things rather than argue with other lawyers. Since I began programming, I've discovered that being a software developer requires the right combination of analytical problem-solving and creativity. I'm particularly enthusiastic about front-end applications because I have an eye for design and functionality. My goal is to find a position where I can continue to create and learn with the same intensity that I have been over the past 3 months.",
